* Wanted to find continuum fit for each order.
* Thought I could do it by thresholding the image and using an OpenCV function to find contours.
* Turns out this is a bad approach.
* However, what it DOES do, is find singular bright spots in the image, which could be useful for cosmic ray detection. I am posting an image here:

* Zooming into a particular dot gives us this. I do not know what this is or why it happens:
