- 2 independent arms of spectrographs
- b&r correspond to each arm
- Raw data:
    - four fits files
    1. subtract overscan region
        a. indicates the counts that we get electronically; we want to remove 
    2. dark current -- 
        counts that accumulate due to temperature of the detector, light leak 
    3. combine 4 different parts of the detector


- Each line, or "spectrum" 
- got to find the 1 dimensional spectra with uncertainties
for each fiber:
y(x), trajectory
lambda(x), or x(lamda), 
trace
